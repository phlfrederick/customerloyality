This repository contains files related to a summarized customer loyalty assignment associated with a course in my masters program titled "Decision Modeling: Probability & Statistics for Business Analytics".

## Summary
A credit card company is focused on gaining customers and keeping them.The company typically
assumes a loss after the customer has signed up for service their first year, However,
following this initial year this typically is followed by profits for the company.Profit is modeled
by a normal distribution in the customerâ€™s nth year of service with the mean actual profits
supplied by historical averages of past data of said customer and a standard deviation of 10%.
There is a churn rate of 15% and a retention rate of 85%.These two values highlight the probability
of a customer ending or continuing business with the company at the end of the year.
The company wants to estimate NPV of the net profit from any customer who has just signed
up for service at the beggining of year 1, at a discount rate of 15% assuming that cash flow
occurs in the middle of the year.It also wants to see how sensitive this NPV is to the rentention
rate.

## Files
The files included in this repository are the .RMD program, the pdf markdown document of the program as well as the excel spreadsheet of the data used for this analysis.
